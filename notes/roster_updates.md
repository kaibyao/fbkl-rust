When do roster updates happen? For example, let's say I activate an RD contract on October 24. We know that the activation happens on 10/24, but it's not actually effective until the following weekly deadline.

As for the deadlines that apply this sort of delayed effect:
* Keeper lock
* Preseason final roster lock
* Weekly roster locks

I think for any transaction made, the deadline assigned by the transaction is the next one that hasn't happened yet, relative to a given date.
