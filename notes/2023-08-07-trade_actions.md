If I propose a trade involving two other teams (A and B) and team A rejects, does the trade end? Or should Team B still be allowed to accept just to signal that he's fine w/ his end of the deal?

... Probably the latter. It feels like the system takes agency away from the owner if they don't have a choice to still respond in a way that matches their evaluation of the deal.
